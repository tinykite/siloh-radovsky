The inaugural episode of the Puff Mall triptych, I begin to investigate the specialty beverage industry and the aesthetic of the urban good life. I imagine myself as Juliette Binoche in the film Chocolat as a way to explore the politics of gourmet treats as panacea, a dream I still long to believe in. Also, can't help but sneak preview the pains of creative production. Brief and full of line drawings.
