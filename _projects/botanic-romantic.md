An herb-y collaboration with Dakota Sexton (writer and web developer): recipes using wild plants that are abundant in Ottertail County, MN. Most of the hard work was done by Dakota--from building the website to designing fonts and logos for the herbs and writing monographs. I added some recipes and wild-crafting know-how.
