In spring 2017, I spent some time at the [Hinge Arts at the Kirkbride](https://springboardforthearts.org/jobs-opportunities/hinge-residency/), an artist residency on the site of the former State mental hospital. The emptied-out space of the Kirkbride (AKA the Fergus Falls Regional Treatment Center) continues to figure strongly in my writing as a scenery or backdrop through which to investigate the ways that mental illness is inflected with, and amplified by, historical conditions. This project, which is informed by my brotherâ€™s experiences with homelessness and mental illness in Minnesota, is now shaping into my thesis work at UCSD. More complete forms of writing forthcoming, but here are some fragments of research, writing, and images which connect either explicitly to the Kirkbride or to these questions about the historicity of treatment and care.
