Delving into journalism for Teen Vogue. This article is based on interviews with Andr√© Thompson and Bryson Chaplin, two brothers who survived a shooting at the hands of Olympia Police Officer Ryan Donald. They were subsequently criminally charged with assault, and spoke to me about their experiences dealing with this aftermath of the physical and judicial violence, including ongoing harassment by the OPD.
