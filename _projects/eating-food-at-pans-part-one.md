"Eating Food at Pans" is a chapbook I wrote in winter 2019, a memoir about being a punk within the world of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and most especially about traveling to Southern California to compete at Pans as a purple and brown belt. It contends with gender and militancy in the sport as well as with the perhaps too-easily accepted practice of weight-cutting. It's also about aspiration generally and a perceived chasm between playing the game and pursuing creativity.
