Siloh Radovsky received her B.A. from the Evergreen State College, where she took an interdisciplinary approach to writing, often merging word and image. Her previous work includes numerous chapbooks as well as non-fiction essays, often themed around the contemporary complexities of utopianism and nostalgia, especially as they relate to art and medicine.

She is presently at work on a short story collection themed around contemporary relationships to bodily health, particularly concerning the treatment of mental illness and emotional malaise.

Her journalistic interests include medicine, lifestyle, and spirituality; politics; history; music and popular media; food and eating; new literary modes; herbalism; and mysticism.

Siloh was recently an artist-in-residence at the [Hinge Arts program](https://springboardforthearts.org/jobs-opportunities/hinge-residency/) in Minnesota, in spring 2017.
