Siloh Radovsky writes personal essays, experimental prose and prose poems, and fiction. She currently resides in San Diego, where she is an MFA student at the University of California. Siloh received her B.A. from the Evergreen State College, where she took an interdisciplinary approach to writing, often merging word and image. Her work has appeared in Teen Vogue and is forthcoming in Alchemy. She is also the author of numerous zines and chapbooks, some of which can be found on this website. Siloh is currently working on experimental, research-based prose concerning contemporary relationships to bodily and emotional wellness, as well as institutional structures of care and their histories.

Her journalistic interests include medicine, lifestyle, and spirituality; politics; history; music and pop culture; food and eating; new literary modes; herbalism; and mysticism.

Siloh was an artist-in-residence at the [Hinge Arts program](https://springboardforthearts.org/jobs-opportunities/hinge-residency/) in Minnesota, in spring 2017.
